This is the first paragraph.
Latex commands begin with a single backslash symbol.
Additional spaces (including end-of-line characters) have
no
effect
when we compile tex files into pdf documents.
To create a new paragraph, use a blank line.

This is the second paragraph. Does it look cool now? What do you want from learning latex?\\
