    Hello, my name is John
    I work in a technology company in Imaginary Country.

Now let's see a cool picture:

% https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Inserting_Images
% h     "Here" Place the float here, i.e., approximately at the same point it occurs in the source text (however, not exactly at the spot)
% t     "Top" Position at the top of the page
% b     "Bottom" Position at the bottom of the page
% !     Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for determining "good" float positions
% ht    "Here" or "Top"
\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=5cm]{img/universe.jpg}
\end{figure}

Do you think the picture above is great?
