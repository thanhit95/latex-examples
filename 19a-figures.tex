\section{Getting started}

\begin{figure}
    Hello, my name is John

    End of figure.

Now let's see a cool picture:

% https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Inserting_Images
% h     Place the float here, i.e., approximately at the same point it occurs in the source text (however, not exactly at the spot)
% t     Position at the top of the page
% b     Position at the bottom of the page
% !     Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for determining "good" float positions
% h!    ...
\begin{figure}[h]
% \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=5cm]{img/universe.jpg}
\end{figure}

Do you think the picture above is great?
